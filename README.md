# Packet Sniffer 

This repository contains a packet sniffer tool developed as part of my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy Infotech. The tool captures and analyzes network packets, displaying details such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.  

## Features  
- Captures network packets.  
- Displays source and destination IP addresses.  
- Identifies the protocol used (e.g., TCP, UDP).  
- Extracts and displays the payload data of the packet.  

## Prerequisites  

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.  
2. Install the `scapy` library by running:  
   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   ```

## Running the Script  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tholumuzikhuboni/PRODIGY_CY_05.git
   cd PRODIGY_CY_05
   ```  

2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python packet_sniffer.py
   ```  

3. The packet details such as source IP, destination IP, protocol, and payload will be printed to the console.  

## Stopping the Script  
To stop the packet sniffer, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal.

## Ethical Considerations  
This tool is for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized packet sniffing is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have proper authorization before deploying or using this tool on any network.  

## Project Context  
This project was developed as the fifth project of my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy Infotech. It demonstrates my skills in network security, packet analysis, and Python programming.
